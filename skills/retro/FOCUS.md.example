# Retro Focus Areas

Copy this file to `FOCUS.md` in the same directory to customize retro analysis categories.
Edit the sections below to reflect your team's priorities. Add or remove categories as needed.

If a **Lint Rules** section is present, the retro will generate lint-rule tasks for
concrete, grep-detectable anti-patterns (max 3, actual mistakes only).

---

## Category A: Process Improvements

Friction in skills, CLAUDE.md, tooling, or instructions. Confusing steps that led to
repeated mistakes or unnecessary backtracking.

## Category B: Tangential Issues

Bugs, tech debt, or architectural concerns discovered out of scope. Things that should
be fixed but weren't the focus of this session.

## Category C: Follow-up Work

Incomplete items, deferred decisions, or edge cases not addressed. Work that should
continue in a future session.

## Category D: Lint Rules

Concrete, grep-detectable anti-patterns observed in this session (max 3).
Only include if an actual mistake occurred that a grep rule would catch.
Do NOT include general advice or style preferences.
